        <p class="subtitle">Used JavaScript to gather and read the data 
            from a JSON file. From that file used Plotly through JavaScript 
            to create several charts to help visualize the data. HTML was used 
            to display the charts.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Summary</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">JavaScript was used to organize and visulize the 
            belly button data in JSON. Several charts were created to help 
            display the data.
            <br>1. First coded the init function was created to create a selector box to select an "Individual" to display their bellybutton data, displaying Test Subject 940 first.
            <br>2. Coded the optionChanged function to then display the different test subject when selecting their number in the selector box.
            <br>3. Created a bar chart using Plotly to display the top 10 bacteria cultures found within the test subjects bellybutton.
            <br>4. Next, created a bubble chart to display the amount of bacteria culture per sample.
            <br>5. Formatted the bubble chart to grow in size as the sample amount gets larger.
            <br>6. Created the gauge on a different function.
            <br>7. Set variables for the data and created new values and labels to set the gauge.
            <br>8. Formatted the layout and edited the title and colors.

        <h1 class="title">Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            The analysis of the data shows that there are tons of bacteria within 
            the human bellybutton and that the diversity is different for everyone. 
            The bar chart displays the top 10 different cultures found and the 
            bubble chart shows the abundance of each culture. The gauge displays on 
            average how often the belly button is washed and it seems like the the 
            average is around 3-5 times a week. The data shows that no two belly buttons 
            are the same and that everyone has a different belly button biodiversity.
